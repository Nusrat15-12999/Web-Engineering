<div id=Introductions>
            <p>
                C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. It
                is a
                structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various
                applications,
                Operating Systems like Windows, and many other complex programs like Oracle database, Git, Python
                interpreter,
                and more.It is said that <b>C</b> is a god's programming language. One can say,C is a base for the
                programming.
                If you
                know <b>C</b> you can easily grasp the knowledge of the other programming languages that uses the
                concept of
                <b>C</b>It is essential to have a background in computer memory mechanisms because it is an important
                aspect
                when
                dealing with the C programming language.

        <h2>History of C</h2>

<div id=History of C>

            <p>C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at bell laboratories of AT&T (American
                Telephone & Telegraph), located in the U.S.A.

                Dennis Ritchie is known as the founder of the c language.

                It was developed to overcome the problems of previous languages such as B, BCPL, etc.Initially, C
                language
                was developed to be used in UNIX operating system. It inherits many features of previous languages such
                as B
                and BCPL.

                Let's see the programming languages that were developed before C language.
            </p>

<h2>How C Programming Language Works?</h2>
        <p>C is a compiled language. A compiler is a special tool that compiles the program and converts it into the
            object
            file which is machine readable. After the compilation process, the linker will combine different object
            files
            and creates a single executable file to run the program. The following diagram shows the execution of a 'C'
            program<br> <br> <img src="7.png" alt="Loading" border="1"><br>Nowadays, various compilers are available
            online,
            and you can use any of those compilers. The functionality will never differ and most of the compilers will
            provide the features required to execute both 'C' programs.

            Following is the list of popular compilers available online: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clang compiler</li>
            <li>MinGW compiler (Minimalist GNU for Windows)</li>
            <li>Portable 'C' compiler</li>
            <li>Turbo C</li>
        </ul>

 <div id=Fundamentals_of_C>

        <h2>C Language Fundamentals</h2>

        <h3><u>Token:</u></h3>
        <p>The smallest element identified bt compiler in a C program called as <b>Token.</b> It may be single character
            or
            sequence of charatcters.Genarally C Supports <b>Six</b> Types of Tokens:</p>
        <img src="10.png" alt="Loading" height="360" width="460">


        <p><b>1. Keywords:</b> Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to
            the
            compiler. Keywords
            are part of the syntax and they cannot be used as an identifier. As C is a case sensitive language, all
            keywords
            must be written in lowercase. Here is a list of all keywords allowed in ANSI C.</p>

        <img src="9.jpg" alt="Loading" height="340" width="500" >

        <p><b>2. Identifier:</b> Identifiers are names given to different entities such as constants, variables,
            structures,
            functions, etc.</p>
        <p style="color:red">Example:</p>

        <img src="5.png" alt="Loading" height="100" width="1000" border="1">
        <p>In the above example, <b>amount</b> and <b>totalbalance</b> are identifiers and int, and double are keywords.
        </p>

        <p><b>3. Constant:</b> Constant are data values that never changes their values during progrm exacution.</p>

        <img src="11.jpg" alt="Loading" height="320" width="500" >

        <p><b>4. String:</b> String is a sequence of characters.In C strings are nothing but an array of characters
            ended
            with a null character ('\0').This null character indicates the end of the string. Strings are always
            enclosed in
            double quotes. Whereas, a character is enclosed in single quotes in C. Declarations for String:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>char string[20] = { 'f', 'o', 'r','g', 'e', 'e', 'k', 's','e', 'k', 's', 'g', 'e', '\0'};</li>

            <li>char string[20] = "Nusrat";</li>

            <li>char string [] = "Nusrat";</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>5. Special symbol:</b>The following special symbols are used in C having some special meaning and thus,
            cannot
            be used for some other purpose.[] () {}, ; * = #</p>
        <img src="13.png" alt="Loading" height="320" width="500" border="1">

        <p><b>6.Operators:</b>An operator is a symbol that takes one or more arguments and operates on them to produce a
            result. Operators are of many types and are considered in operator chapter



            There are many types of operators in C which are given below:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Unary Operator,</li>

            <li>Arithmetic Operator,</li>

            <li>shift Operator,</li>

            <li>Relational Operator,</li>

            <li>Bitwise Operator,</li>

            <li>Logical Operator,</li>

            <li>Ternary Operator and</li>

            <li>Assignment Operator.</li>

        </ul>

        <hr>

<div id=Data_Types>

        <h2>C Data Types</h2>
        <p>A data type specifies the type of data that a variable can store such as integer, floating, character, etc.
            There
            are the following data types in C language.</p> <br>

</div>

<div id= Variables> 
        <h2>C Variables</h2>
        <p>Variables are memory locations(storage area) in the C programming language.
            Some rules in choosing Variables name: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A variable name can consist of Capital letters A-Z, lowercase letters a-z, digits 0-9, and the
                underscore
                character.</li>
            <li>The first character must be a letter or underscore.</li>
            <li>Blank spaces cannot be used in variable names.</li>
            <li>Special characters like #, $ are not allowed.</li>
            <li>C keywords cannot be used as variable names.</li>
            <li>Variable names are case sensitive.</li>
            <li>Values of the variables can be numeric or alphabetic.</li>
            <li>Variable type can be char, int, float, double, or void.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="color:red">syntex:</p>
        <pre>
    type variable_name;

        <p style="color:red">Example:</p>

        <pre>

    int main()
    {
        int age =22; // c program to print value of a variable
        printf("I am %d years old.\n", age);

        <h2>C Program Structure</h2>
        <p>The example discussed above illustrates how a simple C program looks like and how the program segment works.
            A C
            program may contain one or more sections which are figured above.</p>

<div id='Conditional_op'>
    
        <h2>C if...else Statement</h2>
        <p>Programming language uses control statements to cause the flow of execution to advance and branch based on
            changes to the state of a program.Selection statements (if-else, switch) allow your program to choose
            different
            paths of execution based upon the outcome of an expression or the state of a variable.

            C supports various selection statements, like if, if-else and switch . These statements allow us to control
            the
            flow of our program's execution based upon conditions known only during run time.Many times, we need to
            first
            see the condition and then make a decision.
            <br>As an example, consider that a chocolate costs 10 rupees. So, if you have 10 rupees or more, you can buy
            the
            chocolate. <br>
            <img src="16.png" alt="Loading" height="500" width="700">

            But how do we represent this scenario in C? This type of decision taking is done by using if statement in C.
            <br>
            This is a very simple code only to make you understand the use of if,else_if and else. There can be any
            number
            of else if between if and else.<br>

<div id="Loop">
        <h2>C Loop</h2>
        <p> In programming, a loop is used to repeat a block of code until the specified condition is met.C programming
            has
            three types of loops:</p>
        <img src="18.png" alt="Loading" height="400" width="600">

        <br>
        <p><b><u>For Loop:</u></b> A for loop is a more efficient loop structure in 'C' programming. The general
            structure of
            for loop syntax in C is as follows: </p>
        <img src="21.png" alt="Loading" border="1" height="150" width="800">

        <p>Following program illustrates the for loop in C programming example:</p>
        <img src="22.png" alt="Loading" border="1" height="300" width="800">

        <p style="color:red">Output:</p>
        <img src="23.png" alt="Loading" border="1" height="300" width="800">

        <br>
        <p><b><u>While Loop:</u></b> A while loop is the most straightforward looping structure. While loop syntax in C
            programming language is as follows:

            Syntax of while loop in C programming language is as follows: </p>

        <br>

        <p><b><u>Do while Loop:</u></b> A do…while loop in C is similar to the while loop except that the condition is
            always
            executed after the body of a loop. It is also called an exit-controlled loop.

            Syntax of do while loop in C programming language is as follows: </p>

</div>

<div id=array>
        <h2><u>C Arrays</u></h2>
        <p>An array is a variable that can store multiple values. For example, if you want to store 100 integers, you can
            create an array for it.</p>
        <p><strong style="color: brown;">int</strong> data [<strong style="color: chocolate;">100</strong>];</p>
        <img src="30.jpg" alt="Loading" height="300" width="700"border="1">
        <br>

        <h3>How to declare an array?</h3>
    <p>dataType arrayName[arraySize];</p>
    <strong>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(87, 84, 84);">For example:</h3>
    </strong>
    <pre>
    float mark[5];

    Here, we declared an array,<strong>mark</strong>, of floating-point type. And its size is 5. Meaning, it can hold 5
    floating-point values. It's important to note that the size and type of an array cannot be changed once it is declared.

    </pre>

    <h3>How to initialize an array?</h3>
    <p><strong style="color: brown;">int</strong> data [<strong style="color: chocolate;">5</strong>] = {<strong
            style="color: chocolate;">19, 10, 8, 17, 9</strong>};</p>
    <p>Here, we haven't specified the size. However, the compiler knows its size is 5 as we are initializing it with 5
        elements.</p>

<div id=function>
        <h2>C Function</h2>

        <p>C function is a self-contained block of statements that can be executed repeatedly whenever we need it.There
            are two types of function:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Built-in(Library) Functions:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The system provided these functions and stored in the library. Therefore it is also called
                            Library Functions.e.g. scanf(), printf(), strcpy, strlwr, strcmp, strlen, strcat etc.</li>
                        <li>To use these functions, you just need to include the appropriate C header files.</li>
                    </ul>
                </b></li>
            <li><b>User Defined Functions</b> are defined by the user at the time of writing the program.</li>
        </ol>

<p style="font-size: medium;"><u>Parts of functions</u></p>
